# Background

To support fingerprint on Ubuntu, the function is supported by [libfprint][].  
As usual, not every device vendor supports Linux for their device.  
The ways supporting a FP device on libfprint are:
 1. Device vendor contribute their code to [libfprint][].
 2. Community contribute to libfprint by reverse engineering.
 3. Device vendor provide a proprietary  binary based on the [libfprint-tod][] framework.

## FP devices supported by opensource

The devices supported by way 1. and 2. could be found on the [supported device list of libfprint](https://fprint.freedesktop.org/supported-devices.html).  
e.g. [Goodix is contributing to libfprint](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libfprint/libfprint/-/blob/master/libfprint/drivers/goodixmoc/goodix.c) by way 1 on part of their devices.

## FP devices supported by proprietary library

The 3rd way [libfprint-tod][] was built from Ubuntu 20.04 by Marco Trevisan.
It is a way for those Device vendors to contribute their dirver to Linux. Some vendors indeed have concern on protecting their algorithm for security or business.
sofar, only [Goodix][] is supporting [part of their FP devices][goodix tod devices] by 3 which will installed automatically on XPS 9300 ,XPS 9310 by [oem_meta][] and hopfully for all Ubuntu certified machine have [the supported goodix FP devices][goodix tod devices].

AFAIK, fingerprint vendors have limited resource supporting Linux, so the supporting might based on OEM request.
